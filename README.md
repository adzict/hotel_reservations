# Hotel Reservations

The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customersâ€™ behavior. A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.

## Actionable usage:

* Can it be predicted if the customer is going to honor the reservation or cancel it?

## End-user usage:

* Streamlit app that gives us the prediction based on the user input
